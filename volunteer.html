    <h3>Stories from previous years</h3>
    <h4>The One with the Breakthrough</h4>
    <p><em>Jessica (volunteer from Sleepless in Seattle's 2015 Big Give)</em></p>
    <p>"My team was assigned Covington, Black Diamond, Maple Valley and Auburn. We drove all over the place for hours, stopping at every church, park, recreational area, community center, and parking lot. We didn't find anyone until we swung by the Auburn Public Library. That's where we found Jonathan. He had absolutely nothing with him except a small backpack and was shivering from the thin coat he had on.</p>
    <p>As we went through the contents of the care package. He was like a kid in a candy store, but his eyes misted up when I pulled out a handmade card that said "Stay Strong!" I told him I would be writing about him and asked if he had anything to say to the world. He immediately said "tell them that Jonathan McDonald is on his way!" So watch out everyone - with our help and compassion, he can get out from the cold. All he needs is a break, just as all of us needed a break at one time in our life."</p>
    <h4>The One with the Red Gloves</h4>
    <p><em>Kim (volunteer from Sleepless in Seattle's 2014 Big Give)</em>
    <p>"I experienced a few moments towards the end of our mission that will be forever in my mind and heart. We saw several homeless men sleeping on the ground under an overpass in Pioneer Square and we pulled over to offer sleeping bags and a caring word.</p>
    <p>I woke someone covered head to toe in blankets. The face that peeked out was that of an elderly gentleman who appeared to me to be in his eighties. He gave me a sleepy smile and nodded that he would like the sleeping bag I offered. I asked if we could open it and cover him with it and he nodded again. He then nodded towards a red hat and gloves that a prior Good Samaritan had left. I asked if I could help him put them on, and he said no that they were for me... I tried several times to politely decline and he implored me to take them as his Christmas gift to me."</p>
