	    <h1>History</h1>
	    <p>In the fall of 2014, recent University of Washington graduate Eddie Wang decided to bring together a team of volunteers to care for the immediate needs of homeless persons in King County through the use of sleeping bags. The idea to focus on sleeping bags came from Eddie's own experiences working with the homeless and his experiences as a Social Work major at the University of Washington.</p>
	    <p>The volunteer team, fundraised over $75,000 through a November 2014 Indiegogo crowdsourcing campaign and other outside donations and hosted a “Big Give” event where 220 volunteers from around the county gathered to be sent out all around King County to meet every person in need with a sleeping bag (<a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/More-than-3200-homeless-in-King-County-rec-285755091.html">KOMO Coverage</a>). The Big Give is now an annual event focused on helping keep every homeless person in King County warm for the winter through sleeping bags and other related goods.</p>
